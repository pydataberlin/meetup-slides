## Resources

The full source code can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/jtpio/p5-jupyter-notebook, with two Jupyter Notebooks:

- [puzzle_lite.ipynb](https://github.com/jtpio/p5-jupyter-notebook/blob/v4/puzzle_lite.ipynb): notebook used for the presentation (trimmed)
- [puzzle.ipynb](https://github.com/jtpio/p5-jupyter-notebook/blob/v4/puzzle.ipynb): same content but with more details and explanations

# Run with Binder

It is also possible to try and run the notebook with Binder, so you can play with the animations and experiment by yourself right away:
